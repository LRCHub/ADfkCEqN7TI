[00:00.26] The long and winding road
[00:05.81] That leads to your door
[00:15.47] Will never disappear
[00:22.53] I've seen that road before
[00:29.88] It always leads me here
[00:37.11] Lead me to your door
[00:47.11] 
[00:43.14] The wild and windy night
[00:48.72] That the rain washed away
[00:59.21] Has left a pool of tears
[01:06.26] Crying for the day
[01:12.36] Why leave me standing here?
[01:19.25] Let me know the way
[01:28.75] 
[01:26.91] Many times I've been alone
[01:30.57] And many times I've cried
[01:34.22] Anyway, you'll never know
[01:37.70] The many ways I've tried
[01:49.70] 
[01:41.13] And still they lead me back
[01:46.82] To the long, winding road
[01:56.67] You left me standing here
[02:04.29] A long, long time ago
[02:11.30] Don't leave me waiting here
[02:18.82] Lead me to your door
[02:28.82] 
[02:39.12] But still they lead me back
[02:44.83] To the long, winding road
[02:55.30] You left me standing here
[03:02.69] A long, long time ago
[03:09.66] Don't keep me waiting here (don't keep me waiting)
[03:16.96] Lead me to your door
[03:24.94] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
